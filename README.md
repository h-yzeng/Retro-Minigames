# üéÆ Retro MiniGames Project

This project is a collection of retro-styled games built using **Java**. The project also includes a **login system** backed by a MySQL database to store user credentials, high scores, and game statistics. The project is a personal project created to demonstrate Java Proficiency.

## Games Included:
- **Snake** üêç: A classic arcade game where players control a snake and aim to grow longer without colliding with walls or itself.
- **Pong** üèì: A two-player table tennis game featuring paddles and a ball. First player to reach 10 points wins!
- **Tic-Tac-Toe** ‚ùå‚≠ï: A two-player strategy game where players alternate placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid to win.

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and have their personal data stored securely with hashed passwords.
- **Detailed Game Statistics**: Each player‚Äôs high scores and detailed game statistics are tracked and displayed in their profile:
  - **Snake**: High score, total apples eaten, games played.
  - **Pong**: Total points, games played, games won.
  - **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Games played, games won, games drawn.
- **Responsive UI**: Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Swing**.

## Recent Updates:
- Added **detailed game statistics**: tracks draws in Tic-Tac-Toe, total points in Pong, and more.
- **Sound system integration**: added sound effects for key game events such as scoring, winning, and hitting paddles.
- Added **replay dialogs** for each game that allow players to easily restart or exit after finishing a game.
- Updated `UserProfileScreen` to display detailed game statistics.
- Improved **backend data flow** for user and game management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **Java JDK 8** or higher
- **Eclipse IDE**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, or any Java-supporting IDE
- **Git** for version control
- **MySQL** or any other relational database for data storage

## Libraries Used
- **jbcrypt**: For secure password hashing.
- **mysql-connector**: To connect the project to MySQL.

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/h-yzeng/retro-games.git
   cd retro-games

2. **Database Setup**:
- Make sure you have **MySQL** installed and running.
- Import the SQL script located in `/db/create_tables.sql` to set up the required database schema:
  ```bash
  mysql -u your-username -p retro_games_db < db/create_tables.sql

3. **Configure Database**:
- Update the `DatabaseManager.java` file with your MySQL credentials (username, password, database name).

4. **Compile and Run**:
- Open the project in **Eclipse IDE** or your preferred Java IDE.
- Compile the Java files, ensuring the necessary libraries (`jbcrypt` and `mysql-connector`) are in the classpath.
- Run the `LoginScreen` class as the main entry point to the application.

## How to Play

### Snake:
- Use **WASD** keys to control the snake's movement.
- Collect apples to grow longer. Don‚Äôt hit the walls or yourself!
- **Tracked stats**: High score, total apples eaten, games played.

### Pong:
- **W** and **S** keys for Player 1 (left paddle).
- **Up** and **Down** arrow keys for Player 2 (right paddle).
- First to 10 points wins.
- **Tracked stats**: Games played, games won, total points.

### Tic-Tac-Toe:
- Click on the empty grid to place your symbol (X or O).
- Get three in a row to win. A line highlights the winning combination.
- **Tracked stats**: Games played, games won, games drawn.

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/h-yzeng/retro-games.git

2. Setup the database as described above.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE, compile it, and run the `LoginScreen` class to start.
